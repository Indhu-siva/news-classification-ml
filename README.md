# News Classification Detection using Machine Learning

This project aims to classify news articles into different categories using machine learning techniques. The dataset used for training and evaluation is named "train.csv," obtained from Kaggle.

## Overview

The term fake news has become a buzz word these days. There was a time when if anyone needed any news, he or she would wait for the next-day newspaper. However, with the growth of online newspapers who update news almost instantly, people have found a better and faster way to be informed of the matter of his/her interest. Nowadays social-networking systems, online news portals, and other online media have become the main sources of news through which interesting and breaking news are shared at a rapid pace. However, many news portals serve special interest by feeding with distorted, partially correct, and sometimes imaginary news that is likely to attract the attention of a target group of people. Fake news has become a major concern for being destructive sometimes spreading confusion and deliberate disinformation among the people.

The Aims of this projects is to use the Natural Language Processing and Machine learning to detect the Fake news based on the text content of the Article.And after building the suitable Machine learning model to detect the fake/true news
